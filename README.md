# Open Cart Skeleton Module

A skeleton module for Open Cart 2.3. The module itself creates a basic admin area where a user can input the title, copy, and start/end dates for a basic popup. This popup can then be included in any layout style the user defines.

## Getting Started

Download and copy to the root of your open cart installation. No files should be overwritten, as every file here is new.
